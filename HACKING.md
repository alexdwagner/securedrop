# Hacking on the Code

The SecureDrop production environment runs Ubuntu precise. In order to make it so all developers have as similar an environment as possible, we have made it easy to write and test code changes in precise, even if that's not the operating system you're running.

The two ways to do this are using Vagrant or using a chroot jail. Vagrant works by creating an Ubuntu precise VM using VirtualBox and installing a development environment inside of it. Vagrant and VirtualBox are cross-platform, which means this method works in GNU/Linux, OS X, and Windows. However, it won't work if your development environment is already a VM, like if you run Qubes. It also might not work if you're using old hardware that doesn't support 64-bit virtualization. If you can't use Vagrant, you can use a chroot jail instead. Using a chroot jail only works if you're already running GNU/Linux.

## Vagrant and VirtualBox

Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org), clone the git repository, and start vagrant:

	git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop.git
	cd securedrop
	vagrant up

This creates a virtual machine with the SecureDrop codebase in /vagrant. You can edit files on your host machine in your favorite editor, and restart the web servers in the VM to test your changes.

You can ssh into the VM by typing `vagrant ssh`.

SecureDrop consists of two related web applications, one for sources and one for journalists. You can start the web servers from within the VM with:

    cd /vagrant/securedrop
    ./manage.py start

Now you can visit SecureDrop by loading [http://localhost:8080] for the source interface and [http://localhost:8081] for the journalist interface in your web browser.

To run tests:

	cd /vagrant/securedrop
	./manage.py test

For more instructions on how to interact with your VM, refer to the [Vagrant website](http://vagrantup.com).



### Caching Vagrant

Sometimes you will find yourself destroying and provisioning your Vagrant VM
frequently (usually to debug issues in `setup_dev.sh`). The installation process
takes a while, and can quickly become an annoying time waster. To avoid this,
install the vagrant-cachier plugin:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier

This will cache packages from your next provision and use them in the future,
making re-provisioning much, much faster. Installing the plugin is all you need
to do, our Vagrantfile is set up to take advantage of it when it is available.

## Chroot Jail

First install the appropriate dependencies for your VM's OS:

    sudo apt-get install debootstrap schroot
    sudo yum install debootstrap schroot

You can use the script chroot-dev to setup and use your development environment.

	git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop.git
	cd securedrop
    ./chroot-dev

This will show you a list of commands:

    Usage: ./chroot-dev [command]

        up      # create chroot if needed, mount filesystems, start servers
        down    # stop servers, unmount filesystems from chroot
        start   # start securedrop web app servers
        stop    # stop securedrop web app servers
        restart # restart securedrop web app servers
        test    # run tests
        destroy # destroy chroot jail

All you need to do is run `./chroot-dev up`. The first time you do this it will take some time to install and configure your chroot development environment. In the future, all you have to do is run `./chroot-dev up` and you'll be ready to start working.

You can run tests with `./chroot-dev test`.

# Using manage.py

The `securedrop/manage.py` script is provied to help automate common tasks. At
the moment, the following commands are available:

* `start` - start the source and journalist servers
* `test` - run the test suite
* `reset` - reset the state of the development instance

    This is useful if you've changed the database schema and are getting
    errors, but don't want to bother with doing a migration.
